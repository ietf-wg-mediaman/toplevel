1.  Introduction

   This document defines best practices for defining new top-level media
   types.  RFC 6838 [RFC6838] very consisely defines the conditions for
   defining additional top-level media types.  This document expands
   this slightly.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  The real beef@@@@

   For reference in further discussion, we first cite the two paragraphs
   we are thinking about updating.

2.1.  RFC 6838, section 4.2.5

   Section 4.2.5 of RFC 6838 reads as follows:

   4.2.5.  Application Media Types

   The "application" top-level type is to be used for discrete data that
   do not fit under any of the other type names, and particularly for
   data to be processed by some type of application program.  This is
   information that must be processed by an application before it is
   viewable or usable by a user.  Expected uses for the "application"
   type name include but are not limited to file transfer, spreadsheets,
   presentations, scheduling data, and languages for "active"
   (computational) material.  (The last, in particular, can pose

   security problems that must be understood by implementors.  The
   "application/postscript" media type registration in [RFC2046]
   provides a good example of how to handle these issues.)

   For example, a meeting scheduler might define a standard
   representation for information about proposed meeting dates.  An
   intelligent user agent would use this information to conduct a dialog
   with the user, and might then send additional material based on that
   dialog.  More generally, there have been several "active" languages
   developed in which programs in a suitably specialized language are
   transported to a remote location and automatically run in the
   recipient's environment.  Such applications may be defined as
   subtypes of the "application" top-level type.

   The subtype of "application" will often either be the name or include
   part of the name of the application for which the data are intended.
   This does not mean, however, that any application program name may
   simply be used freely as a subtype of "application"; the subtype
   needs to be registered.

2.2.  RFC 6838, section 4.2.7

   Section 4.2.7 of RFC 6838 reads as follows:

   4.2.7.  Additional Top-Level Types

   In some cases, a new media type may not "fit" under any currently
   defined top-level type names.  Such cases are expected to be quite
   rare.  However, if such a case does arise, a new type name can be
   defined to accommodate it.  Definition of a new top-level type name
   MUST be done via a Standards Track RFC; no other mechanism can be
   used to define additional type names.

2.3.  History of Additional Top-Level Types

   The first time an additional top-level type was defined was in RFC
   1437 [RFC1437], but this was purely for entertainment purposes
   (please watch date).

3.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

4.  Security Considerations

   To be completed.

Acknowledgements

   The initial encouragement for writing this draft came from Harald
   Alvestrand.  Further encouragement was provided by Murray S.
   Kucherawy.  Both Harald and Murray also provided ideas for actual
   text.  Without them, this memo would never have reached even the
   first draft stage.
