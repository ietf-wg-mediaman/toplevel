      <name>The real beef@@@@</name>
      <t>For reference in further discussion, we first cite the two paragraphs
      we are thinking about updating.</t>
      <section>
        <name>RFC 6838, section 4.2.5</name>
        <t>Section 4.2.5 of RFC 6838 reads as follows:</t>
        <t>4.2.5.  Application Media Types</t>
          
          <t>The "application" top-level type is to be used for discrete data that
          do not fit under any of the other type names, and particularly for
          data to be processed by some type of application program.  This is
          information that must be processed by an application before it is
          viewable or usable by a user.  Expected uses for the "application"
          type name include but are not limited to file transfer, spreadsheets,
          presentations, scheduling data, and languages for "active"
          (computational) material.  (The last, in particular, can pose
          security problems that must be understood by implementors.  The
          "application/postscript" media type registration in [RFC2046]
          provides a good example of how to handle these issues.)</t>
          
          <t>For example, a meeting scheduler might define a standard
          representation for information about proposed meeting dates.  An
          intelligent user agent would use this information to conduct a dialog
          with the user, and might then send additional material based on that
          dialog.  More generally, there have been several "active" languages
          developed in which programs in a suitably specialized language are
          transported to a remote location and automatically run in the
          recipient's environment.  Such applications may be defined as
          subtypes of the "application" top-level type.</t>
          
          <t>The subtype of "application" will often either be the name or include
          part of the name of the application for which the data are intended.
          This does not mean, however, that any application program name may
          simply be used freely as a subtype of "application"; the subtype
          needs to be registered.</t>
          
      </section>
      <section>
        <name>RFC 6838, section 4.2.7</name>
        <t>Section 4.2.7 of RFC 6838 reads as follows:</t>
        <t>4.2.7.  Additional Top-Level Types</t>
          
          <t>In some cases, a new media type may not "fit" under any currently
          defined top-level type names.  Such cases are expected to be quite
          rare.  However, if such a case does arise, a new type name can be
          defined to accommodate it.  Definition of a new top-level type name
          MUST be done via a Standards Track RFC; no other mechanism can be
          used to define additional type names.</t>
      </section>
      <section>
        <name>History of Additional Top-Level Types</name>
        <t>The first time an additional top-level type was defined was in
          <xref target="RFC1437" format="default">RFC 1437</xref>, but this
          was purely for entertainment purposes (please watch date).</t>

      Further encouragement was provided by Murray S. Kucherawy. Both Harald and
      Murray also provided ideas for actual text. Without them, this memo would
      never have reached even the first draft stage.</t>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

   <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
    1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
    2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
       (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

    Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
    If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
    directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
    with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
    filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
